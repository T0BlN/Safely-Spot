# UI/UX Design and Style Guidelines

## 1. Color Schemes

We use a consistent color palette across components. For example, our primary interactive elements (buttons, tags, and controls) use a vibrant green (`#4CAF50`) with contrasting text (`#000`). Additional colors include:

- **Primary Color:** `#4CAF50`  
- **Secondary Color:** `#000`  
- **Background Colors:** White (`#fff`) for cards and forms, and a light gray (`#f9f9f9` or `#F5F5F5`) for container backgrounds.

## 2. Typography

- **Font Family:** We generally use system fonts or a font like `Segoe UI, Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif` for clarity and accessibility.
- **Headings & Body Text:**  
  - Headings (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) should be bold and larger in size.
  - Body text should be legible at around `16px` with adequate line-height (approximately `1.5` to `1.8`).

## 3. Spacing and Layout Principles

- **Spacing:**  
  - Consistent margins and paddings are applied across components (e.g., `15px` or `20px` in forms and cards).
  - Use a base spacing unit (e.g., `8px` or `16px`) to maintain uniformity.
  
- **Layout:**  
  - Cards, forms, and containers are centered with appropriate margins (e.g., `max-width: 800px` for main pages).
  - Use border-radius (typically `4px` to `8px`) for a friendly and approachable design.
  - 
  
## 4. Component Behavior

### Hover Effects and Transitions

- **Buttons and Interactive Elements:**
  - On hover, buttons scale slightly (e.g., `transform: scale(1.05)`) and show a subtle box-shadow.
  - Transition effects are typically set to `0.2s` ease to provide smooth feedback.
